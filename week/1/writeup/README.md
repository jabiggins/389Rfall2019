### Part 2 (75 pts)

  I claim that as soon as you learn of the problem, you have the responsibility to do everything in your power to see that the public is not harmed by your companies work. But, I also claim that you have a strong responsibility to that company. You should first go to your boss and talk about the severity of the problem; however, what makes this action important is how you do it. I think that one should do so in an open setting so multiple other employees are aware of the problem you found. In doing so, you increase the likelihood that this problem will be addressed and make the next step less dangerous to yourself. If your company does not act on this information, you have the responsibility to let appropriate parties hear about this, but also respect whatever agreement you contractedly swore to uphold when you landed the job. Having done these steps, I argue that ethically you are no longer responsible for the result.

  Opposing parties may claim that this does not go far enough, and that you should tell the public immediately. However, I think that in doing so, they are essentially ranking your word and your different commitments. Instead I argue that one is obligated to evaluate how best to honor all of the responsibilities one has, be it to the company and to the general public. Other parties may claim that you are not responsible for doing anything further than telling your immediate boss. However, I argue that relying on the ethical standards of a single person above you is not sufficient, and that you should make your ethical appeal to multiple parties in order to have actually tried your best at working with the organization that pays you.
